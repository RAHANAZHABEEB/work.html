        <h1 style="text-align: center;">ZUDIO</h1>
        <p>Zudio has cracked the code to India’s fashion industry. The 500-million-dollar fashion brand, which was unknown 2 years ago, is now giving giants like West Side, Pantaloons, and Max a run for their moneyIndia has a very exciting Fashion retail market right now. And while most brands have always targeted urban tier one customers, they have only recently realized that the real money resides in Bharat, the tier two, three, and four cities. Customers in these cities spend 77% more than tier one in their last online shopping transaction. This is where Zudio and the world of value fashion come into the picture.The Indian fashion customer is interesting; if they spend a higher amount, they look for Brands like Zara and H&M, but when they don’t want to spend a higher amount, they look for Indian value Brands. And this is what dictates the core pricing insight for Zudio. They have one clear value prop on pricing: everything under 999, while keeping up to date with the most recent trends.Zudio was aware of the fact that their customers don’t necessarily care about labels; all they want is clothing that looks great and is affordable. They had a clear understanding of their core user base — college students and tier two, three folks — for whom looking on-trend is super important for their social circle, but they can’t afford to spend a lot.This flywheel turns in itself and sustains their business. Zudio’s rate of churning out its inventory is rapid; they refresh products on a weekly basis at a rate of 160%, making sure their store looks new with new products and styles every two months. Think about it; every two months, every Zudio practically becomes new, and none of their competitors have been able to crack this. This also Depends on store decor, interior, and staff salaries which are super low, letting their inventory take care of store refresh is a genius idea. That obsession with inventory management extends even to them staying away from merchandise like winter wear, which can only be sold for a limited period, like one or two months in a year. By avoiding such merchandise selections, Zudio eliminates the risk of being stuck with unsold inventory for an entire year if the season doesn’t perform well.</p>
